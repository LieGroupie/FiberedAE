# FiberedAE
Implementation of Fibered Auto-Encoders (FAEs)
FAE are Auto Encoders whose space of latent variables have a fiber bundle structure. This implementation acts as a proof of concept and aims at illustrating the concept.
    
This repository contains all code for creating and training FAEs.

  * Examples in the form of Jupyter notebooks are available in the the folder: **/demos**.
  * Model hyper-parameters can be found in a human readable format in: **/demos/configuration**.
